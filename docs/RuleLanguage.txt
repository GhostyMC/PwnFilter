Lexigraphic Format of rules.txt
===============================

Tokens
------

Each statement is composed of at least one top-level token from:

Section definition tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
match
rule
actiongroup
conditiongroup

Toggle tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
shortcuts

Rule tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^
actions
conditions
then
require
ignore

Section definition tokens
-------------------------
When these tokens are encountered, they start a section, which continues
until the next blank line, or the end of the file.  Each of these tokens
can only appear _once_ in a section.

A rule section can be started with either 'match' or 'rule'. The other token
can be used in the following line, eg:
match <regex>
rule <id> [description]

OR

rule <id> [description]
match <regex>

actiongroup <name>
conditiongroup <name>


Toggle tokens
-------------
These toggle behaviour in the parser.  The only one we have right now is:

shortcuts [shortcut_file]


Rule tokens
-----------
These tokens can only be used in a rule / group:

Action tokens
=============
then

Condition tokens
================
require
ignore
